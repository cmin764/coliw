Hello and welcome to the *CoLiW* documentation. This is a simple web application
able to mimic a basic shell window (CLI) for being able to access various
APIs and retrieve information.

Right now we support:

    - **ipinfo** Get IP info and geo location
    - **weather** Get weather by a city
    - **walpha** Compute math expressions

You will find this service deployed at the following address:
